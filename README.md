### HTML Prototype
This branch was used to create a dummy HTML file along with the necessary CSS to model the structure of the map.

### Initial Class Design
This branch was used to create classes and empty methods along with failing tests. Afterwards, logic was added to each method such that the tests succeeded were possible.

### HTML Generation
This branch was used to write the code that would create an HTML file for each player.

### Algorithm
This branch was used to create the basic game loop and logic for the user to play. Moreover, previously failing tests were now a success due to the added logic.

### Bugfix Map Generation
This branch was created to solve an issue with the map as each player had the same map object. This was resolved by generating a seed.

### Coverage
This branch was created to add more tests to increase coverage.
